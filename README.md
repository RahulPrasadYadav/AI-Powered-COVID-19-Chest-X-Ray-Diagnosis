Problem:
Accurately diagnosing COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and other lung conditions from chest X-rays is time-consuming and requires expert radiologists, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Manual analysis can lead to delays in treatment and higher chances of human error.

There is a need for an automated, AI-powered tool that can quickly analyze chest X-ray images and provide reliable predictions to assist healthcare professionals and streamline preliminary diagnosis.
